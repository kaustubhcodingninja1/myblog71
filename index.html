      Steeped In Tradition
      A trip through the hallways at Xavier High School, a stroll through the yearbooks, time spent looking through the many files and boxes in the archives in the back of the library is an education in itself.
      
       
      A school should make you thirst for knowledge, so exploring the 57-year history of this school and its many traditions whets the appetite. It leads  to answering many questions and raising others.
      
       
      
      We want to learn more about the significance of St. Francis Xavier and all that is in the Xavier crest.
      
       
      
      What is the history of the student newspaper? Why is the yearbook named “The Don?”
      
       
      
      What were the rules like back in 1963 as compared to now? And just how did Xavier get the nickname Falcons and colors black and white?
      
       
      
      Let's find out about the 25th, 40th and 50th anniversaries of the school and the various dedications as the school expanded.
      
       
      
      Dust off the archives, dig deep into one’s memory. The answers to more than 20 questions lie in photos, newspaper clippings, yearbooks, files, and the memories of faculty and staff.
      
       
      
      As we stroll through the building, it soon becomes clear to keep our eyes open at every turn. You never know what you’ll see in the building. A 9-11 flag. A statue of St. Joseph. A photo of Bro. Celestine. More questions arise. So more answers are needed.
      
       
      
      The short history is this: Xavier opened its doors in 1963 and was founded by The Most Rev. Vincent J. Hines, the second bishop of the Diocese of Norwich, pictured above in a groundbreaking ceremony in 1961. It is a Xaverian Brothers' Sponsored School, and at the heart of its mission is this written by St. Irenaeus: "The glory of God is the human person fully alive." Xavier seeks to educate the whole person: spirit, mind and body."
      
       
      
      But that is the one-paragraph description. Our stroll down memory lane is divided into multiple parts. This history project originally was published in 2019, but we know history does not stop, so we knew more would have to be written. We had no idea we would be writing about the coronavirus but just added that chapter.</p>

    <p class = "text-muted" ></p>Within the Catholic tradition and within the context of a Christian community, Xavier seeks to educate the whole man – spirit, mind and body.

    Through academic, religious, service, athletic and extracurricular programs, the school endeavors to form a man who is academically competent, spiritually alive and physically sound. By providing a community centered on Judeo-Christian values, the school seeks to support the student in his growth as a human being and to instill in him a sense of responsibility for the gifts which are his.
 
    St. Iraneus wrote: “The glory of God is the human being fully alive.”
 
    At graduation, then, the Xavier man should be intellectually prepared to undertake collegiate studies or to enter the work force, to make mature choices and to take responsibility for his life and his gifts; and to have an understanding of Christian values and the obligations to his fellow human beings which these values entail.

      I am pleased to welcome you to the home page of the Psychological Service Center of Xavier University.

Since 1962 the psychologists and staff of the PSC have been providing care for the psychological needs of the Xavier community's students, faculty and staff.

Over the years, PSC staff members have also offered a range of psychological services to the Greater Cincinnati community. We are committed to providing culturally competent care to diverse individuals.

The PSC is a department within the Division of Student Affairs and consequently, has a mission to develop a sense of the whole person's body, mind, and spirit.

We provide treatment which emphasizes an integrative approach and attempts to help individuals improve their quality of life.

The psychologists at the PSC are faculty members in the School of Psychology who have specialties primarily in clinical but also in industrial/organizational psychology.

We also have psychology trainees from the School of Psychology working in our Center.

These individuals are completing their doctoral training in clinical psychology and work under the direct supervision of our clinical psychologists.

Our administrative assistant can be helpful in answering many of the questions you may have regarding our services.

Many individuals seek our services because they feel depressed, are having problems with roommates/significant others/spouses, are struggling academically due to feelings of anxiety or stress, are having family problems, or are having eating problems.

If you think that you or a friend could benefit from services for these kinds of problems or other related issues, please call to schedule an appointment and/or get further information at (513) 745-3531.

We will attempt to provide the help that you need or we will refer you to the appropriate provider.
